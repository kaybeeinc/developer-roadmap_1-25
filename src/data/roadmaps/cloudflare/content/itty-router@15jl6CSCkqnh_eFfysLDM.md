# Itty Router

Itty Router is a lightweight router with the motto "less is more" that supports Cloudflare workers and pages. While other libraries may suffer from feature creep/bloat to please a wider audience, Itty Router painfully consider every single byte added to itty. Our router options range from ~450 bytes to ~970 bytes for a batteries-included version with built-in defaults, error handling, formatting, etc. On top of that, the following concepts aim to keep YOUR code tiny (and readable) as well.
